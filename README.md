1. Project Overview
   
Energy consumption in steel manufacturing is highly dynamic due to heavy machinery, variable load types, and continuous operations. This project analyzes electrical parameters such as reactive power, power factor, CO₂ emission, and day/time patterns to:

✔ Optimize electricity usage

✔ Reduce operational cost

✔ Prevent power factor penalties
✔ Improve load scheduling
✔ Support ESG/environment commitments

This repository provides a complete ML pipeline from EDA to forecasting models.

2. Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
XGBoost / RandomForest / GradientBoosting
TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM/GRU)
Prophet (optional)
Tableau (Dashboard Integration)
