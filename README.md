# Smart-Energy-Forecasting-System-for-Steel-Manufacturing
AI-powered energy analytics system for the steel industry. Includes full workflow: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, time-series train–test split, ML/DL modeling for energy usage prediction, CO₂ emission forecasting, and load type classification. Designed for real-world energy optimization and sustainability insights.

1. Project Overview
   
Energy consumption in steel manufacturing is highly dynamic due to heavy machinery, variable load types, and continuous operations. This project analyzes electrical parameters such as reactive power, power factor, CO₂ emission, and day/time patterns to:

✔ Optimize electricity usage
✔ Reduce operational cost
✔ Prevent power factor penalties
✔ Improve load scheduling
✔ Support ESG/environment commitments

This repository provides a complete ML pipeline from EDA to forecasting models.
